Installation / Usage
--------------------

The general way of installing a new Presentation experiment is to unpack it from the file archiving format it was sent in to a sensible directory.

Often machine specific settings will need to be change in the experiment file.

[Presentation](http://www.neurobs.com/) needs to be installed in order to run the task. The website for Presentation includes good help resources and forums for technical issues.
