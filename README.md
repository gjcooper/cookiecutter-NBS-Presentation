# CookieCutter NBS-Presentation

An extremely bare bones cookiecutter template for Presentation experiments

It creates the folder structure used in house and adds one experiment file with a linked scenario and PCL file

The original cookiecutter project can be found: 
  [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)

## Using CookieCutter for your project

    $ pip install cookiecutter
    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/gjcooper/cookiecutter-NBS-Presentation

The setup script will ask you some basic information including name and email address which will then be used in your new project.

## Purpose

The purpose here is to streamline the setup of a new Presentation experiment. It is super minimalistic, ignoring documentation other than a Readme. It will set up a data folder and a stimuli folder.
